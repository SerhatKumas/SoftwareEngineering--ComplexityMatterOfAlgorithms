# SoftwareEngineering--ComplexityMatterOfAlgorithms
- This project has been created while practising the complexity and basics of design techniques of algorithms.
  
- Main folder has Complexity and basics of design techniques basics pdf that explains the subjects.
  
- Documentation folders contain pdf created by taking notes while studying. In short, pdfs explain the basics.

- Folder also have images and some other supportive documentation.

- In implementations, my main purpose was to practise and understand the basics of the subjects.

## Visualization Tools
- https://visualgo.net/en -> Various data structures and algorithms visualization tool, it was beneficial to understand how efficient algorithms are.
  
- https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms -> Run time comparing for different variations visualization


## References
- All the references used in the projecs are given in pdf files under Documentation folders.
